## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   JDK 21 or higher
*   Apache Maven

### Installation and Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alllexey123/openjfs
    cd openjfs
    ```

2.  **Build the Application:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**

    *   **Using Maven:**
        ```bash
        export OPENJFS_DATA_PATH=/path/to/your/files
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```

    *   **From the Executable JAR:**
        ```bash
        export OPENJFS_DATA_PATH=/path/to/your/files
        java -jar target/openjfs-*.jar
        ```

## Usage
Once running, you can access your files at `http://localhost:8080`. 

### Downloading
You can download your files using `http://localhost:8080/direct/path_to_your/file.ext`. Using `OPENJFS_ALLOW_ZIP_DIRECTORIES=true` will zip directories on the fly.

For example, a file located at `${OPENJFS_DATA_PATH}/documents/report.pdf` would be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/direct/documents/report.pdf`.

### JSON Listing
You can get basic file/directory info using `http://localhost:8080/list/path_to_your/dir`.
Example response: 
```json
{
  "path": "",
  "name": "dir",
  "lastModified": "2025-08-04T16:28:37.23",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "dir/",
      "name": "file1.txt",
      "lastModified": "2025-08-04T15:07:10.41",
      "size": 5,
      "type": "REGULAR_FILE"
    }
  ],
  "type": "DIRECTORY"
}
```
