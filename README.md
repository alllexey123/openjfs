## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   JDK 21 or higher
*   Apache Maven

### Installation and Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alllexey123/openjfs
    cd openjfs
    ```

2.  **Build the Application:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**

    *   **Using Maven:**
        ```bash
        export OPENJFS_DATA_PATH=/path/to/your/files
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```

    *   **From the Executable JAR:**
        ```bash
        export OPENJFS_DATA_PATH=/path/to/your/files
        java -jar target/openjfs-*.jar
        ```

    Once running, you can access your files at `http://localhost:8080`. For example, a file located at `/path/to/your/files/documents/report.pdf` would be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/direct/documents/report.pdf`.
